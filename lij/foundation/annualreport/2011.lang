;Mozilla‘s vision of the Internet is a place where anyone can access information, a place where everyone can hack and tinker; one that has openness, freedom and transparency; where users have control over their personal data and where all minds have the freedom to create and to consume without walls or tight restrictions.
A vixón che o gh'à Mozilla pe l'Internet a l'é 'n pòsto dónde tùtti pêuan acêde a-e informaçioìn, un pòsto dónde tùtti pêuan parteçipâ e sperimentâ l'avertûa a libertæ e-a trasparénsa; dôve i uténti gh'àn o contròllo di seu dæti personâli e dôve tùtte-e ménti gh'àn a libertæ de creâ e consumâ sénsa miâge ò restriçioìn.

;In less than 20 years the Internet has changed our lives. It is a powerful platform with unprecedented opportunity and connectedness. But even with great growth and innovation there are significant challenges to this vision of a healthy Internet.
Inti ùrtimi 20 ànni l'Internet o l'à cangiòu e nòstre vìtte. L'é 'na piatafórma con oportunitæ e conetivitæ sénsa precedénti. Ma co-a grànde créscita e inovaçioìn gh'é de signifîve sfìdde a sta vixón de 'n Internet sàn.

;Mozilla is mobilized to ensure the protection of the Web and to empower tomorrow’s webmakers and Web users. Today, Mozilla is growing — with more employees, contributors, products and locations — to ensure that the Web remains an open, vibrant ecosystem. Because, the Web is the platform for building the world we want.
Mozilla o s'é mobilitòu pe aseguâ a proteçión do Web e rénde ciù fòrti quélli che faiàn o web domàn e i ùtenti do Web. Ancheu, Mozilla o crésce — con ciù inpiegæ, contribuitoî, prodûti e locatizaçión — pe aseguâ ch'o Web o réste un ecoscistêma avèrto e vibrànte. Perché, o Web o l'é a piatafórma pe costruî o móndo che voémmo.

;Mozilla Mobilized
Mobilitæ da Mozilla

;Mozilla is mobilizing millions of people to build the world they want. Mobilizing to set the mobile Web free from proprietary platforms and gatekeepers. Mobilizing to empower the world's next two billion Web users. And mobilizing to build a new generation of digital innovators, creators and webmakers.

;Moving forward we will continue to focus on building products, technology solutions and educational offerings that incorporate Mozilla values into the Web. Today, Mozilla’s mission remains as important as ever. From Firefox through Firefox OS to our new Mozilla Webmaker educational offering, the goal is empowerment. It’s about unlocking the full creative power of mobile; standing up for user sovereignty, privacy and freedom; and helping millions of people move from using the Web to actively building its future.

;Just like we did on the desktop, Mozilla is setting out to ensure that the mobile Web is full of freedom, choice and opportunity and that it has the ability for users to create anything they want. With <a href="%(fxos_url)s">Firefox OS</a>, we can break open the world of native operating systems and closed platforms once again.
Coscì cómme in sciô computer, Mozilla o se da da fâ pe asegûa che o Web in sciô telefonìn o ségge pìn de libertæ, scélta e òportunitæ e che ghe ségge a posibilitæ pe-i uténti de creâ tùtto quéllo ch'êuan.

;Firefox OS is the first truly open mobile platform. Developers are already embracing HTML5, but so far HTML5 applications on mobile have been held back because they can’t access the device’s underlying capabilities the way that native apps can. Firefox OS overcomes these limitations and provides the necessary <abbr title="Application Program Interfaces">APIs</abbr> to show how it is possible to run an entire device using open standards.
Firefox OS o l'é a prìmma piatafórma pe telefonìn avèrta pe davéi. I svilupatoî són za into l'HTML5, ma én asæ lontàn da aplicaçioìn HTML5 pe telefonìn perché no pêuan acêde a-e fonçionalitæ bâze cómme e aplicaçioìn natîve.

;Firefox OS devices will launch in early 2013 through <a href="%(telefonica_url)s" rel="external">Telefónica</a>, establishing HTML5 as a viable platform for the mobile industry. The Web as the platform will free developers to create groundbreaking new apps that work seamlessly across all devices, spurring a new era of innovation and creativity for the ubiquitous Web.

# Fast. Smart. Safe." is a slogan for Firefox for Android. It appears here as three separate strings for styling and layout purposes.
;Fast.

;Smart.

;Safe.

;In June 2012 we released an update to <a href="%(mobile_url)s" rel="external">Firefox for Android</a> that we believe is the best browser for Android available. We completely rebuilt and redesigned the product in native UI, resulting in a snappy and dynamic upgrade to mobile browsing that is significantly faster than the Android stock browser. This made Firefox significantly faster on Android and delivered a much better browsing experience to users than the one offered by the device’s stock browser. We also added Do Not Track to Firefox for Android to let users express their intent for privacy, even on mobile and are the first mobile browser to offer Do Not Track. Firefox for Android is a critical part of supporting the open Web. This is a great start, but it is only a start. We want these opportunities to exist at all layers of our Web experience.

;Firefox will always be the part of the Mozilla mission that people can see, feel and touch. We are excited by the progress and innovation we have seen with the desktop version of Firefox over the past year. Several performance and security improvements, memory enhancements make this the best Firefox yet. We're proud of the work that we're doing to make developing on Firefox easier by adding exciting tools for developers, like <a href="%(cmdline_url)s" rel="external">Developer Command Line</a>, <a href="%(console_url)s" rel="external">Web Console</a> and <a href="%(tilt_url)s" rel="external">“Tilt” the 3D Page Inspector</a>.

;Recently, we have been experimenting with ways to integrate social functionality into Firefox. Firefox will support a new Social API that lets developers integrate social services directly into the browser. The Social API will support multiple providers and has endless potential for integrating social networks, e-mail, finance, news and other applications into your Firefox experience. Our first experimental provider is Facebook.

;Mozilla is proudly non-profit and answers to no one but you. That means we're uniquely able to fight for users at a critical moment in the Web's history. Looking forward, we will mobilize millions of people to stand up for privacy, security and online freedom. We will take on new threats to the Web's future — from locked down proprietary platforms, to would-be censors and gatekeepers, to short-sighted government legislation. Together we will set the mobile Web free, reassert the vital importance of privacy and user sovereignty, and join others in building a more Web-literate world.

;Do Not Track

;Our Internet experiences involve more of our personal data, which forms a picture or profile of who we are online. The ability for organizations to monitor, log, store, use, correlate and sell information about who we are and what we do has huge implications for individuals and for society.

;In an effort to give users more control over their Web experiences, we developed the <a href="%(dnt_url)s" rel="external">Do Not Track</a> feature in Firefox. We also became the first browser manufacturer to offer it on multiple platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux and Android. <a href="%(dntfxos_url)s" rel="external">Do Not Track is even available for Firefox OS</a> so that user privacy settings can be controlled on a system-wide level to ensure that every third-party application on a user's device respects their choice.

;Mozilla was instrumental in the movement to motivate the Web community to act against the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect IP act. These laws, had they gone into effect, would have given the US government and private businesses incredible censorship powers that would have global ramifications, weaken the Internet's security and discourage innovation and investment worldwide.

;At Mozilla, we measure success by how much we are doing to improve the overall health of the Web and advance the interests of users and developers. We succeed when we build products that people love, and when other organizations build the traits and features we care about into competing products. For example, we view Google Chrome's recent implementation of the Do Not Track feature we pioneered to be a success for Mozilla and our mission.
