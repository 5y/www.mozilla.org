;Does Do Not Track block ads?
Wala Ma ši ay gana ga feeyan hode?


;No, you will still see ads with Do Not Track enabled. However, Do Not Track may change the type of ads you see.

If you request that websites Do Not Track you, and the sites respect your privacy preferences, you will see more generic ads in place of behavioral ads.

;Do Not Track may interfere with some personalized services you enjoy. For example, a Do Not Track request might mean you would have to type in your zip code each time you want to view a weather report, rather than seeing the weather automatically displayed. Personalization on websites can save you time and repetitive typing, but it requires data.
