;Lightbeam for Firefox
Firefox için Lightbeam


;Lightbeam is a Firefox add-on that uses interactive visualizations to show you the first and third party sites you interact with on the Web.
Lightbeam, Web’de etkileşime girdiğiniz birinci ve üçüncü parti siteleri size göstermek için interaktif görselleştirmeleri kullanan bir Firefox eklentisidir.


;Shine a Light on Who’s Watching You
Sizi izleyenlere ışık tutun


;See who’s tracking you online
Sizi internette kimlerin izlediğini görün


;As you browse, Lightbeam reveals the full depth of the Web today, including parts that are not transparent to the average user.
Siz gezindikçe Lightbeam de Web’in ulaştığı derinliği, ortalama bir kullanıcının göremeyeceği kısımlarıyla birlikte gözler önüne serer.

;How Lightbeam Works
Lightbeam nasıl çalışır?


;Download and run the Lightbeam add-on in your Firefox browser.
Lightbeam eklentisini indirip Firefox tarayıcınızda çalıştırın.


;Lightbeam will create a record of events for every site you visit and every third party site that is stored locally on your browser.
Lightbeam, ziyaret ettiğiniz her sitenin ve tarayıcınızın ulaştığı her üçüncü parti sitenin etkinliklerinin kaydını oluşturacaktır.


;Lightbeam visually graphs these events to highlight the interactions between sites you intentionally visit and the third parties.
Lightbeam, bilerek ziyaret ettiğiniz sitelerle üçüncü partiler arasındaki etkileşimleri göstermek için bu etkinlikler görsel hale getirir.


;Lightbeam will continue to add to your graph as you browse the Web. You can stop Lightbeam at any time by disabling it or uninstalling the add-on. Your Lightbeam data can be easily saved or deleted.
Siz Web’de dolaştıkça Lightbeam grafiğiniz büyümeye devam edecektir. İstediğiniz zaman eklentiyi devre dışı bırakarak veya kaldırarak Lightbeam’i kapatabilirsiniz. Lightbeam verilerinizi kolayca kaydedebilir veya silebilirsiniz.


;Tracking & privacy
İzleme ve gizlilik


;Not all tracking is bad. Many services rely on user data to provide relevant content and enhance your online experience.
Her izlemenin niyeti bozuk değildir. Birçok servis, sizinle ilgili içerik sunmak veya internet deneyiminizi geliştirmek için kullanıcı verilerinden yararlanır.


;But tracking can happen without the user’s knowledge.
Ama izleme, kullanıcının bilgisi dışında da gerçekleşebilir.


;That’s not okay for some.
Bazı kullanıcılar bunu kabullenmez.


;It should be you who decides when, how and if you want your browsing data to be shared. We recognize the importance of transparency and our mission is all about empowering users — both with tools and information.
Gezinti verilerinizin ne zaman, nasıl ve kiminle paylaşılacağına karar veren siz olmalısınız. Biz saydamlığın önemini anlıyoruz. Misyonumuz, gerek yeni araçlar gerekse bilgilendirme yoluyla gücü kullanıcıların eline vermektir.


;Explore the database
Veritabanını keşfedin


;In the Lightbeam database, you will be able to browse first and third-party connection data uploaded by donors who use the Lightbeam add-on.
Lightbeam eklentisini kullanan gönüllülerin yüklediği birinci ve üçüncü parti bağlantı verilerini Lightbeam veritabanında görebileceksiniz.


;We’re building this crowd-sourced directory to encourage users to visualize the state of tracking as an aggregate and to examine relationships that exist on the Web.
Kitle kaynaklı bu dizini, kullanıcılarımızı izlemenin vardığı son noktayı topluca görselleştirmeye teşvik etmekve Web’de var olan ilişkileri incelemek için inşa ediyoruz.


;Visualize your data
Verilerinizi görselleştirin


;After you download and install the Lightbeam add-on to Firefox, it will begin to create a real time visualization of the websites you visit and all the third parties that are also active on those pages.
Firefox için Lightbeam eklentisini indirdiğinizde eklenti, ziyaret ettiğiniz web sitelerinin ve o sayfalarda etkin olan tüm üçüncü partilerin gerçek zamanlı bir görselleştirmesini oluşturmaya başlar.


;Analyze your connections
Bağlantılarınızı analiz edin


;As your visualizations grow, you can take a closer look into the relationships between the various first and third party sites that are stored in your data. You can also reset or save your data at any time.
Görselleştirmeleriniz büyüdükçe, depolanan çeşitli ilk ve üçüncü parti siteler arasındaki ilişkilere daha yakından bakabilirsiniz. Ayrıca istediğiniz zaman verilerinizi sıfırlayabilir veya kaydedebilirsiniz.


;Contribute your data
Verilerinizi bağışlayın


;As a part of Lightbeam, we are creating a big-picture view of Internet tracking and of how first and third party sites are connected.
Lightbeam ile birlikte hem internet takibinin hem de birinci ve üçüncü parti sitelerin nasıl bağlı olduklarının daha büyük bir görüntüsünü oluşturuyoruz.


;To help us, you can contribute your data to our Lightbeam database.
Bize yardımcı olmak isterseniz verilerinizi Lightbeam veritabanıyla paylaşabilirsiniz.

Ford Vakfı’nın desteğiyle


;The work at the Ford Foundation focuses on building outreach campaigns to help people understand online data tracking — both the benefits and the issues
Ford Vakfı’nın çalışmaları, insanların internette veri takibinin hem faydalarını hem de sorunlarını anlamaları için bilgilendirme kampanyaları oluşturmaya odaklanır
