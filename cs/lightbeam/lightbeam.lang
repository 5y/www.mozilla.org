;How Lightbeam Works
Jak Lightbeam pracuje


;Download and run the Lightbeam add-on in your Firefox browser.
Stáhnete si a spusťte doplněk Lightbeam ve svém prohlížeči Firefox.


;Lightbeam will create a record of events for every site you visit and every third party site that is stored locally on your browser.
Lightbeam vytváří záznamy událostí pro každou stránku, kterou navštívíte a každé třetí strany, jejíž data jsou uložena do vašeho počítače.


;Lightbeam visually graphs these events to highlight the interactions between sites you intentionally visit and the third parties.
Lightbeam zobrazuje grafy těchto událostí pro zvýraznění interakcí mezi stránkami, které jste navštívili záměrně a třetími stranami.


;Lightbeam will continue to add to your graph as you browse the Web. You can stop Lightbeam at any time by disabling it or uninstalling the add-on. Your Lightbeam data can be easily saved or deleted.
Lightbeam nadále graf aktualizuje během dalšího surfování. Kdykoliv jej můžete vypnout nebo celý doplněk odinstalovat. Vaše data z Lightbeam mohou být snadno uložena nebo smazána.


;Tracking & privacy
Sledování a soukromí


;Not all tracking is bad. Many services rely on user data to provide relevant content and enhance your online experience.
Ne všechna sledování jsou špatná. Mnoho služeb je závislých na uživatelských datech pro poskytnutí odpovídajícího obsahu a pro zlepšení jejich užitku.


;But tracking can happen without the user’s knowledge.
Ale ke sledování může docházet bez uživatelova vědomí.


;That’s not okay for some.
To už zcela v pořádku není.


;It should be you who decides when, how and if you want your browsing data to be shared. We recognize the importance of transparency and our mission is all about empowering users — both with tools and information.
Měli byste to být vy, kdo rozhodne, jak a jestli mají být vaše data o surfování sdílena. Víme, že transparentnost je důležitá a naším cílem je dát uživatelům do rukou nástroje i informace, jak mít o všem přehled.
