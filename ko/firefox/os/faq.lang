;What is Firefox OS?
Firefox OS는 무엇인가요?


;Backed by some of the biggest names in the industry, Firefox OS is a new open operating system for smartphones developed by Mozilla.
업계 유명 벤더들이 많이 있지만, Firefox OS는 Mozilla가 만드는 스마트폰을 위한 새로운 개방형 운영체제입니다. 전적으로 HTML5와 개방형 웹 표준으로만 만들어지고 있으며 기존의 상용 플랫폼의 제한과 규정으로 부터 자유로운 운영체제입니다.


;Built entirely using HTML5 and other open Web standards, Firefox OS is free from the rules and restrictions of existing proprietary platforms.
HTML5 및 개방형 웹 표준 기술로만 만들어진 Firefox OS는 기존 상용 플랫폼의 제한 과 규정에서 자유롭습니다.

다른 폰은 켜면 같은 앱만 보이는 정적인 화면을 제공한다면, Firefox OS는 여러분의 삶의 시간에 필요한 정확한 앱을 늘 변화하면서 제공해줄 것입니다.


;It adapts so you can live every moment to its fullest.
매일의 일상 속 순간 순간 함께합니다.
