;Lightbeam for Firefox
Lightbeam Firefoxerako


;Lightbeam is a Firefox add-on that uses interactive visualizations to show you the first and third party sites you interact with on the Web.
Lightbeam Firefoxerako gehigarri bat da, bistaratze interaktiboen bitartez zurekin elkarreragiten duten webguneak erakusten dizkizuna — bai zuzenean bisitatutakoak, bai hirugarrengoak.


;Shine a Light on Who’s Watching You
Ezagutu nork zelatatzen zaituen


;See who’s tracking you online
Ikusi nork zelatatzen zaituen sarean


;As you browse, Lightbeam reveals the full depth of the Web today, including parts that are not transparent to the average user.
Nabigatu ahala, Lightbeam-ek gaur egungo webaren sakonera osoa erakusten dizu, erabiltzaile arruntarentzat gardenak ez diren zatiak barne.

;How Lightbeam Works
Nola funtzionatzen du Lightbeam-ek?


;Download and run the Lightbeam add-on in your Firefox browser.
Deskargatu eta exekutatu Lightbeam gehigarria Firefox nabigatzailea erabiliz.


;Lightbeam will create a record of events for every site you visit and every third party site that is stored locally on your browser.
Lightbeam-ek gertakarien erregistro bat sortuko du bisitatzen duzun gune bakoitzeko, eta baita nabigatzailean lokalki biltegiratzen den hirugarrengo gune bakoitzeko.


;Lightbeam visually graphs these events to highlight the interactions between sites you intentionally visit and the third parties.
Lightbeam-ek gertakari hauek grafikoki bistaratzen ditu, nahita bisitatu dituzun guneen eta hirugarrengoen arteko interakzioak nabarmentzeko.


;Lightbeam will continue to add to your graph as you browse the Web. You can stop Lightbeam at any time by disabling it or uninstalling the add-on. Your Lightbeam data can be easily saved or deleted.
Webean nabigatu ahala, Lightbeam-ek grafikora datuak gehitzen jarraituko du. Lightbeam edonoiz geldi dezakezu, gehigarria desgaituz edo desinstalatuz. Zure Lightbeam-eko datuak era errazean gorde edo ezaba daitezke.


;Tracking & privacy
Segimendua eta pribatutasuna


;Not all tracking is bad. Many services rely on user data to provide relevant content and enhance your online experience.
Segimendua ez da beti txarra. Zerbitzu askok erabiltzaileen datuak darabiltzate eduki garrantzitsua erakusteko eta zure lineako esperientzia hobetzeko.


;But tracking can happen without the user’s knowledge.
Baina batzuetan segimendua erabiltzailea ohartu gabe egiten da.


;That’s not okay for some.
Eta hori ez da ona.


;It should be you who decides when, how and if you want your browsing data to be shared. We recognize the importance of transparency and our mission is all about empowering users — both with tools and information.
Zeu izan beharko zinateke nabigazio-datuak noiz eta nola partekatu nahi dituzun erabakitzen duena. Aintzat hartzen dugu gardentasunak duen garrantzia, eta gure misioa erabiltzaileei boterea ematea da — bai tresnak erabiltzean, bai informazioari dagokionean.


;Explore the database
Arakatu datu-basea


;In the Lightbeam database, you will be able to browse first and third-party connection data uploaded by donors who use the Lightbeam add-on.
Lightbeam-en datu-basean, gehigarria darabilten, eta haien datuak partekatu dituzten erabiltzaileen konexio-datuak arakatu ahalko dituzu, bai zuzeneko konexioenak, bai hirugarrengoenak.


;We’re building this crowd-sourced directory to encourage users to visualize the state of tracking as an aggregate and to examine relationships that exist on the Web.
Herriak eraikitako direktorio hau sortuz, erabiltzaileek segimenduen ikuspegi globala izan dezaten nahi dugu, webean existitzen diren erlazioak aztertuz..


;Visualize your data
Bistaratu zure datuak


;After you download and install the Lightbeam add-on to Firefox, it will begin to create a real time visualization of the websites you visit and all the third parties that are also active on those pages.
Firefoxerako Lightbeam gehigarria deskargatu eta instalatu ondoren, bisitatzen dituzun webguneen, eta orri horietan aktibo dauden hirugarrengoen denbora errealeko bistaratzea osatzen hasiko da gehigarria.


;Analyze your connections
Aztertu zure konexioak


;As your visualizations grow, you can take a closer look into the relationships between the various first and third party sites that are stored in your data. You can also reset or save your data at any time.
Grafikoa hazi ahala, datuak gertutik azter ditzakezu, zuzenean bisitatutako guneen eta hirugarrengoen arteko erlazioak arakatuz. Datuok nahi duzunean berrezarri edo gorde ditzakezu.


;Contribute your data
Lagundu besteei zure datuekin


;As a part of Lightbeam, we are creating a big-picture view of Internet tracking and of how first and third party sites are connected.
Lightbeam-eko partaide gisa, Interneteko segimenduen irudi erraldoi bat osatzen ari gara, zuzenean bisitatutako guneak eta hirugarrengoak nola dauden konektatuta ikusteko.


;To help us, you can contribute your data to our Lightbeam database.
Guri laguntzeko, zure datuak Lightbeam-en datu-basera gehi ditzakezu.
